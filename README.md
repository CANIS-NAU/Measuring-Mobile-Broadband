# Measuring Mobile Broadband
Scripts and code and Wikis around measuring mobile broadband and different data
sets.
## Intro and Description
The CANIS research lab manages this repo under the leadership of Dr. Morgan
Vigil-Hayes. The goal of this project is to research how the unlicensed
frequency bands of Educational Broadband Service (EBS) and the Citizens Band
Radio Service (CBRS) perform in a variety of locations, in order to provide
better wireless broadband to rural areas. We will be using several ruggedized
spectrum sensors employing a Raspberry Pi and HackRF One in order to measure
wireless signal performance. Wireless performance metrics such as Receiver
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and Reference
Signals Received Power (RSRP) are strong predictors of wireless network
performance.

- HackRF One
## Software
- Raspbian Buster 10
- qspectrumanalyzer
- libhackrf (from the libhackrf0 aptitude package)
